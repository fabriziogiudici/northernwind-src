    <p><span class="firstLetter">O</span>ne of the things that most casual photographers don't get is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management">color
        management</a>. What's the matter? Well, if you are the only person looking at your photos - or, better, your
      photos are only shown through a single appliance - and you don't look at others' photos, there's no issue. If you
      use multiple devices, publish your photos to the web, send them to a print lab or look at others' works, you have
      a problem. The fact is that the culture behind home computers and TV appliances has spread the false notion that a
      color on a display can be described as a simple triplet of numbers, the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB</a>
      values. This is only partially true: yes, displays render colors by means of those three values, but a given RGB
      triplet won't render the same color in two different displays, or a display and a print. First, for displays,
      rendered colors depend also on the settings of the device (e.g. brightness, contrast, saturation, etc...), but
      above all different models are capable of rendering different ranges of colors (technically called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut"><em>
          gamut</em></a>). This means that if you don't consider color management, that fantastic RGB value that renders
      the garden grass so good on your monitor will appear different in every other display. Not to mention your
      printing lab: if you don't cope with color management in the proper fashion, there's no way to get your prints
      without an annoying color cast. The problem, indeed, started even at a prior step, since even the RGB values in a
      digital photo file are relative to the camera capabilities, so perhaps you're blaming your camera for producing
      poor colors, while it's your monitor. Sure, you can postprocess your photo with an editing software until it looks
      good on your display, but other people will see the results of your editing in a different way.</p>

    <p> There is a number of excellent technical introductions to color calibration and the science behind it. Here I'd
      only like to give a fundamental recap for practical purposes. </p>
    <h4>Where do colors come from</h4>
    <p>First, color is related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"><em>light</em></a>, which is
      electromagnetic radiation, whose main property is the <em>frequency</em> (or the related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength"><em>wavelength</em></a>).
      The so-called <em>rainbow colors</em> are the range of all the kinds of visible light which is <em>monochromatic</em>,
      that is composed by a single radiation with a given frequency. In practice, pure monochromatic colors seldom occur
      (basically, only in laser emitters), while an everyday color is made by a mixture of different frequencies and a
      physicist would describe it with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum"><em>spectrum</em></a>,
      a diagram that tells us the relative distribution of different light frequencies in a given measurement.</p>
    <p> But we're talking about photos, thus how a human being perceives things. Perception is related to physics, but
      by means of an indirection layer. It happens that our eyes are composed by three kinds of receptor cells, that are
      sensible to three different wavelengths (roughly red, green and blue). This means that if we want to describe a
      perceived color in a unique and unambiguous way we must use values representing the stimuli of the receptor cells.
      Ignoring the slight differences of perception among individuals (and pathologies too), experts have defined a
      standard set of coordinates to represent those stimuli: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space"><em>CIE
          1931 XYZ space</em></a> (for practical purposes experts have defined also alternate perceptual spaces which
      are equivalent, but for simplicity we can just refer to XYZ). </p>
    <div align="center"> <img alt="" class="framedPhoto" src="$mediaLink(relativePath='/graphics/325px-CIE_1931_XYZ_Color_Matching_Functions.svg.png')$" /> <img alt="" class="framedPhoto" src="$mediaLink(relativePath='/graphics/300px-CIExy1931.png')$" />

        area is known as the "chromaticity diagram": everything inside it is a perceivable color (courtesy of Wikimedia
        Commons).</p>
    </div>
    <h4>There's white and white</h4>
    <p>There's a further point to deal with, the notion of white. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"><em>White
          color</em></a> is defined as the brightest possible light perception and for human beings living on the Earth
      the natural brightest light source is the sun. So, perceptually talking, the sun is white (beware that an
      astronomer classifies it in a different way) and it's extremely stable. It apparently changes color through the
      day because of the relative position to the atmosphere, with the brightest light occurring around noon. From a
      physical point of view, the sun emits light because it's hot, and physics relates that kind of thermal light
      emission to the surface temperature. That's why white quality is referred as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature"><em>color
          temperature</em></a> and is measured in Kelvin degrees, usually between 5000K and 6500K. Lower temperatures
      are called "warm" or "reddish" whites, upper temperatures are called "cool" or "bluish" whites (note that warm and
      cool are referred in the opposite way as in our general culture that associates blue with ice or fresh water).</p>
    <p> Things are not so easy, though, because the human vision is capable of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_adaptation"><em>chromatic
          adaptation</em></a>: it's more a brain than eye thing and it involves identifying objects. For instance, we
      identify a red apple under the sunlight and we will still identify it as red when it's lighted in a different way.
      Furthermore, we tend to mentally define as "white" the brightest color in a scene after a given time, so when we
      are at home in the evening we'll designate as white the color of a lightbulb, which is very different than the
      sun, and appropriately compensate the perception of the object colors lighted by that lightbulb. </p>
        <div align="center"><a href="$mediaLink(relativePath='/stillimages/20050313-0354/1280/image.jpg')$" rel="lightbox" title="This little white-egret has been shot with a complex lighting environment: backlighted by the&#10;        late-afternoon sun, with a flash to fill shadows.

        this subtleness, but if you look through a monitor which is not properly profiled the effect is likely to be
        destroyed.</p></div>
    <p> Managing color temperature (also known as <em>white balancing</em>) is important, since the "warmness" of a
      color has a relevant impact on how a photo is interpreted. Lack of or bad color management might render in a cool
      way a sunset, which is supposed to give a warm feeling, or render warm a depiction of penguins on ice. To make
      things even more complex, since a printed photo is always seen under an external lighting source, its perceived
      color temperature can be very different in function of the ambient light. Given this mess, experts have defined
      some standards to operate: the practice mandates that a printed photo is viewed under a light at 5000K (called
      also D50), and not by chance in professional exhibitions the light bulbs are picked accordingly, while <a href="http://www.boscarol.com/blog/?p=8014">monitors
        should be calibrated at 6500K</a> (D65). The difference in temperature compensates perceptual changes due to the
      fact that a photo print relies on reflected light, while a monitor is self-illuminated. Following this practice,
      in a properly profiled environment a photo viewed at 5000K will match in the best way its rendering on a screen
      calibrated at 6500K. Note that if you want to print your photos for hanging on a wall at home, not an exhibit, it
      might make more sense to measure the white point of the lights in the room and properly compensate the printing
      rather than buy a set of 5000K lightbulbs, which are expensive and might not produce the best lighting environment
      to live within.</p>
    <h4>Calibration and characterization</h4>
    <p>Given the previous premises, we can now describe what color management is. The first thing to do is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management#Calibration"><em>calibration</em></a>,
      that is to adjust the behavior of the monitor so its colors are rendered in a consistent fashion. For instance,
      once one has set the white point, all the gray shades must appear "neutral", without color casts. Calibration
      doesn't solve our problem yet, but prepares the monitor so the next steps will achieve better results.</p>
    <p> The second thing to do is to define the gamut for the monitor, a process called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management#Characterization"><em>characterization</em></a>,
      together with a formula to convert the RGB values specific to the device to the universally valid XYZ and back to
      the RGB values specific to another device. This makes it possible to consistently render the same color through a
      number of different devices. This formula is part of a <em>color profile</em>, which in a computer is typically
      an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile">ICC</a> file. The idea is that since RGB values are
      relative to a device, a photo should always travel with an embedded profile, and any rendering device should have
      its profile as well; this makes it possible to have that RGB(1) - XYZ - RGB(2) translation. Characterization is
      meaningful for printing too, even though printers don't use RGB but other ways to create colors (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model">CMYK</a>).
In
      a perfect world, manufacturers would ship a working profile together with their monitor or printer, but in
      practice they don't do that, or ship a profile which is extremely imprecise. It's also to be said that devices
      slightly change their color capabilities with time, so you have to repeat the process every in a while, thus
      having an initial factory profile probably doesn't make much sense. </p>
    <h4>Rendering intents</h4>
    <p>Once we have the conversion formula, we must realize that not every conversion is possible: for instance if we
      try to render a photo with a wide gamut on a display with a narrower gamut. In this case some colors are  not
      renderable and they are said <em>out-of-gamut</em>. Out-of-gamut colors can be handled in different ways (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management#Rendering_intent"><em>rendering
          intents</em></a>): for instance, a graphic designer wants to accurately preserve in-gamut colors such as in
      brands and logos, at expense of clipping (burning) out-of-gamut colors, while a photographer usually prefers to do
      some global adjustment to fit everything. Since gamuts are described by three coordinates, much like 3D objects in
      real life, it helps visualizing them as physical objects (in the original XYZ space gamuts have got a very strange
      shape, for this reason experts defined alternate equivalent spaces, such as L*a*b*, where shapes are simpler). So,
      the problem of adapting an image to a device with a smaller gamut is analogous to the problem of fitting an object
      into a smaller box: you can just clip exceeding parts (<em>relative colorimetric intent</em>, which replaces
      clipped colors with the closest ones inside the target gamut, and visually will burn some colors), or
      proportionally shrink the object, preserving its overall shape (<em>perceptual intent</em>). Images with colors
      near or beyond the boundary of the target gamut (typically saturated colors) will be better handled by a
      perceptual intent, partially changing most of the original hues in the whole photo, in order not to introduce burn
      outs; images whose colors are within the target gamut (typically pastel colors) will be better handled with a
      relative colorimetric intent which won't introduce any change in the perception.</p>

        reveal too much.</p></div>
    <h4>Standard gamuts</h4>
    <p>There is a number of standard gamuts defined by the industry. The NTSC gamut is a very wide one used in
      broadcasting (not to be confused with the NTSC scanline standard); <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProPhoto_RGB_color_space">ProPhoto
        RGB</a> is another very wide gamut, once uncommon, but made popular since it's the one used by Adobe Lightroom;
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_RGB_color_space">Adobe RGB</a> is a very popular one with
      professionals, smaller than NTSC or ProPhoto; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB_color_space">sRGB</a> is
      an even smaller gamut for generic web rendering. <a href="http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?WorkingSpaceInfo.html">Bruce
        Lindbloom has got a more comprehensive list</a>, as well as an interactive 3D viewer (in L*a*b* coordinates).
      The gamut of many consumer computer displays is definitely small - things have started to change only recently,
      with "wide gamut" products (even in this case, quite a range of greens are left out). Clearly, the best things
      happen when you use a monitor and printer capable of the largest possible gamuts and process the image with the
      largest space available. While this in the past was the domain of expensive professional products, now things are
      changing fast.</p>

    </div>
    <h4>Profiling in practice</h4>
    <p>The process for profiling a monitor needs a physical device, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristimulus_colorimeter">colorimeter</a>,
      which is a sensor laid over the screen capable to measure colors. After suggesting the proper settings for the
      monitor (that must not be changed), a specific software fills the monitor with a set of color patches (usually a
      few hundreds) and measures them. With some mathematical computations, the software produces an ICC file which
      contains both the calibration and the characterization. There are pieces of software that offers profiling without
      a sensor, by relying instead on feedback from human observation, but don't trust them: they will inevitably lead
      to inaccurate results. If you repeat the profiling process for all the rendering devices you own, you will be able
      to see your photos in a way so that they match as much as possible (they will look identical in devices with the
      same gamut). Of course, if you publish your photos to the web, you must invite people to seriously consider
      calibration. If they don't, they won't see your work as they should, but at least they have been warned.</p>
    <div align="center"><a href="$mediaLink(relativePath='/stillimages/20060703-0060/1280/image.jpg')$" rel="lightbox" title="Lavender field at Senanque. In my experience lavender can be a critical subject for the correct&#10;        reproduction of colors. Its violet tint can have or not a pinkish hue in function of the color temperature.

        the web with an uncalibrated monitor see something quite different from the original.</p></div>
    <h4>The web is broken</h4>
    <p>There are two other problems. Unfortunately most of smartphones and tablets, though they are more and more used
      to render photos, lack any calibration software. But even the old plain web can be a problem, as most of the
      current popular desktop browsers <a href="http://www.gballard.net/psd/go_live_page_profile/embeddedJPEGprofiles.html">can't
        properly manage color profiles different than sRGB</a>. Unfortunately the noble art of photography undergoes a
      sort of violence perpetrated by the consumer market ignorance. This means that in order to maximize the chances
      that your photos are properly viewed by other people, including those who calibrated their monitors, you must
      convert the published copy of your work to the sRGB color space that, being so small, will inevitably destroy part
      of the subtle color hues that you might have. You can alternatively publish a second set of photos with a broader
      space, such as AdobeRGB or ProPhoto RGB, to be enjoyed by people who not only have calibrated their display, but
      also know what software to use for the proper rendering. Harder job, but which delivers an enhanced viewing
      experience. </p>
