<p>The <a href="http://www.bythom.com/300afslens.htm">Nikkor AF-S
300 f/4</a> is my preferred weapon for bird shooting and it's an
excellent performer from the optical point of view, even when
paired with a teleconverter. While there are no problems at all
with still or slow-moving birds, issues arise with the autofocus
tracking speed for flying animals.</p>
<p>Large flocks (or flocks of large birds) taken at a distance
aren't a problem, as well as birds fly orthogonally or obliquely to
the line of sight, because the focused point distance doesn't
change too quickly. In such scenarios, the lens is able to properly
track focus also when used with a 2x teleconverter (which slows
down the autofocusing speed proportionally to its magnifying
factor) as the flamingoes photo demonstrates, and in case of poor
light, as the last cranes photo demonstrates.</p>

<p>Things get more complicated with single small birds (or flocks
of small birds) since the involved distances are shorter and the
focused point moves quickly along the line of sight. But with a few
practice, and taking large amounts of continuous shots, the job can
be done, even with problematic birds such as terns (whose flight is
usually nevrotic and unpredictable). While the 2x teleconverter
can't be used in these cases, the 1.4x and 1.7x prove to be
effective. Note that the sandwich tern has been photographed with
an old Nikon D100, which had a very limited autofocusing
module.</p>

<p>I've recently had troubles with a small flock of wading birds
(dunlins and little stints) that used to fly back and forth a few
meters from me, along the line of sight, thus creating the
circumstances where the focused point distance changes at the
maximum rate. I was only able to take a very few decently focused
shots of the birds in flight, and zero focused shots of the landing
moment, which usually is rich of interesting poses.</p>
<p>For instance, in the photo below the bird at the upper left
position is indeed in focus, but it's not the one I wanted! I was
instead tracking the foreground birds - the lens just stayed behind
their motion (even though I didn't mount any teleconverter) and I
got that different focused subject by chance.</p>

<p>Is it an intrinsic limitation of my equipment, or technique can
help?</p>
<p>These are the factors involved with getting a good focus on fast
moving objects:</p>
<ol>
<li>The intrinsic speed of the lens (or camera) autofocusing
engine.</li>
<li>The presence of focus limiters, which prevent from wasting time
in hunting focus in ranges that can be excluded <em>a
priori</em>.</li>
<li>The maximum aperture of the lens, since the focus detectors in
the camera work better with more light.</li>
<li>The computing power of the camera microprocessor, which might
take longer or faster to complete the computation of the focusing
point distance.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first three items are related to the lens. For the Nikkor
AF-S 300 f/4D:</p>
<ol>
<li>The lens has got an ultrasonic motor which is very fast. Bigger
guns such as the 300, 400, 500 and 600 f/2.8 have even faster
motors, but they are a completely different price class and at
present time, and for the foreseeable future, I can't afford an
upgrade.</li>
<li>The lens has got a focus limiter that excludes searches for
subjects closer than 3 meters. It gives a dramatic improvement in
autofocusing speed, but since 99% of the flying birds that I shoot
at are much far away, I wish I had another button for excluding
e.g. shorter ranges than 10 meters. Again, the bigger guns have got
more flexibility with this respect.</li>
<li>The lens has got a f/4 maximum aperture; bigger guns have got
f/2.8.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, things could be improved by upgrading to a better lens, but
I can't do now. I've also seen an old AF-S 300 f/2.8D that has been
bought used for about 1.000 &euro;, but they are hard to find. In
any case, bigger lenses are heavier and are less easily
handled.</p>
<p>The fourth and last point is related to the camera body. Also in
this case, upgrading my Nikon D200 to a newer model such as the
D300s (which has got a very improved autofocusing module) would
help. This will be eventually done, but not before the end of 2010.
What other chances are available in the meantime?</p>

alt="D200 / D2X Focus Modes (from LuminescentPhoto.com)"
src="http://www.luminescentphoto.com/articles/CAM2000/DSCN0280.jpg" />It's
worth while studying the autofocusing module of the Nikon D200 and
its Multi-CAM 1000 autofocusing module. A good description is
provided by <a
href="http://www.nikonians.org/nikon/d200_multi-cam_af/index.html">this
post at Nikonians</a> and an interesting discussion about the D200
focusing of flying birds is <a
href="http://photo.net/nikon-camera-forum/00MD8Z">available at
Photo.Net</a>. Furthermore, a description about the Multi-CAM 2000
module used by D2X is available <a
href="http://www.luminescentphoto.com/articles/CAM2000/cam2000.html">at
Luminescence of Nature&trade;</a> - while it's a better performance
version of the Multi-CAM 1000, it shares very similar function
modes.</p>
<p class="caption">from <a
href="http://www.luminescentphoto.com/">Luminescence of
Nature&trade;</a></p>
<p>In particular, the last article tells us that the four
autofocusing modes engage the camera body computer in different
ways, with different speeds of the response:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-Area AF (fastest)</li>
<li>Group Dynamic AF with center area priority</li>
<li>Group Dynamic AF with closest-subject priority</li>
<li>Single Area Dynamic AF</li>
<li>Dynamic AF with closest-subject priority (slowest)</li>
</ul>
<p>The fastest, Single-Area AF, is hardly usable for flying birds,
because it's difficult to keep them centered on the sensor
(especially with birds whose flight path is unpredictable, such as
terns). For this reason, Group Dynamic AF with center area priority
sounds as the most effective one: it allows to select a subset of
the sensors, thus providing more coverage than Single-Area, but
reducing the flow of data to process by the camera
microprocessor.</p>
<p>If you read the three articles, you'll also learn that other
settings can dramatically influence the focusing speed - for
instance, the Lock On&reg; feature. In the end, there's a number of
settings that must be properly set every time you switch from
static or slowly moving subjects to flying birds, and it's not easy
to always recall them in the field.</p>
<p>The D200 helps as it allows us to define up to four
&ldquo;banks&rdquo;, that are groups of settings that can be
switched simoultaneously. These are the three banks that I've been
using since the latest summer:</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that, of course, Servo Mode and Focus Mode aren't selected
by banks, but must be operated with the relative switches; I've
just annotated in the table the most significative settings for
each bank. So, each time I switch the class of subject, I have to
change three things: the Servo Mode, the Focus Mode and the
bank.</p>
<p>This approach let me improve significantly the ability of
tracking flying birds, until I found the above cited problems with
the little wading birds. For this reason, I'm presently searching
for even further improvements, that I'll blog about when they are
eventually found.</p>
